  This question is used to introduce your interview. Please customize
id: Motionforcontinuance
continue button field: MotionForContinuance_intro
question: |
  These instructions are meant to guide you through the process of requesting a continuance.
subquestion: |
  Courts take scheduled dates seriously. A continuance should be asked for only as a last option. Filing a Motion for Continuance does not automatically mean you will get a continuance. If the court does not give you a continuance, the case will move forward according to the already scheduled date.

  This interview is not legal advice and cannot take the place of the advice that a lawyer can give you. It is always best to speak with a lawyer before taking any legal action. When you represent yourself in court, you must follow all the proper procedures and the law. It is your responsibility to see your case through the whole process.

  1.	Be sure you have the correct form.
  2.	Read all instructions before you begin.
  3.	Answer with 100% accurate information. Any false statement made in court or written in a court document may constitute perjury.
  4.	Check all options that pertain to your situation.
  5.	Attach any supporting documentation (i.e., a doctor’s note) related to your request.
